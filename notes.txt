========================

Image and text recognition/ Brijaesh text recognition - Automation

Uday -> image -> citrix optimization.

Sameer -> password reset -> with a chat bot. 

==================================

1. Input -> Create a set of images which fall under, Clean desk(nothing else on the desk except for keyboard and mouse), Violation(cell phone, pen, paper, food, mug, other electronic devices)
2. Output -> Recognize the facial, categorize desk as clean or not clean, categorize the agent behavior as working, not working.




select count(payroll) from emp_organization where (regexp_like (station,'^009[0-9][0-9]$') or station = '00802') and eff_from_date <= sysdate and eff_to_date >= sysdate
and upper(class) not in ('Z','Y')
